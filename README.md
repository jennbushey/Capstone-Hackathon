# Alberta’s Waiting Times for Specialty Care App

# Summary

This project was developed during a hackathon at the University of Calgary on March 2, 2024. The goal of the project was to create a mobile application to increase accessibility and transparency to the waiting times in specialty care in Alberta. The team collaborated to design an Android application using React Native, with a focus on creating a visually appealing interface that effectively communicates the essence of the project to potential funders.

## Abstract

For the healthcare stakeholders in Alberta, would using the mobile application increase accessibility and transparency to the waiting time in specialty care? To address the question, we propose a theoretical model of mobile application usage to foresee the waiting times of specialty care in Alberta. Special attention is paid to the Canadians who are waiting to see their healthcare providers, but do not have access to see the transparent data of the waiting list. We aim to secure transparency of the waiting list and enable stakeholders to access their waiting times per mobile application usage. Central to the research question, our research assesses the timeline of the stakeholders from getting a referral to a specialist to receive their intervention. In this context, we aim to leverage the existing data on waiting time toward the mobile application. The “Alberta Waiting Times Reporting” [AWTR] website will be used as a supplemental database and the “My Health Records” [MHR] application operated by EPIC, which is the electrical health record system, will be used as an integration technology in our healthcare digital solution. In the application, the users will be able to visibly foresee the specialist’s information based on the location, specialty, waiting time, and personalized referral by tapping on the waiting time function.

## Project Documents

-   [Project Proposal](https://github.com/jennbushey/Capstone-Hackathon/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.pdf) outlines the purpose, goals, scope, and stakeholders of a project. It often includes a high-level overview of the project's objectives, deliverables, timeline, and budget.
-   [Functional and Non-Functional Requirements](https://github.com/jennbushey/Capstone-Hackathon/blob/main/App%20Requirements.pdf). Functional Requirements specify the functionalities or features that a system or product must provide. They describe what the system should do. Non-Functional Requirements define the quality attributes, constraints, and limitations of a system or product. They describe how the system should perform.
-   [Wireframes](https://github.com/jennbushey/Capstone-Hackathon/blob/main/Wireframes.pdf) are visual representations (usually simple sketches or diagrams) to illustrate the layout and functionality of a system or product's user interface. Wireframes are used to communicate the design and functionality of a project before actual development begins.

This demo video showcases the Alberta’s Waiting Times for Specialty Care App, a mobile application designed to increase accessibility and transparency to waiting times in specialty care. The video demonstrates the following key features:

1. **Waiting Time Tab**: A dedicated function on the MHR application to display waiting time data, with each function being tappable for smooth transitions.
1. **Procedure, Region, and Urgency Functions**: Tabs displaying procedure, region, and urgency functions, each represented by a distinct logo for easy identification.
1. **Tab Highlighting**: The currently viewed tab is highlighted in blue for user awareness.
1. **Fast Navigation**: Clicking any function shows the next page within 10 seconds for efficient navigation.
1. **Specialist Information**: The application displays a list of specialists with their specialties, allowing users to research specialists before appointments.
1. **Healthcare Zone Map**: Users can view and select healthcare zones for more accurate waiting time information.
1. **Physician's Information**: The application shows physician's name, clinic address (italicized), and hospitals served.
1. **Urgency Level Selection**: A bar to select the urgency level of intervention needed, displayed from 1-10 with corresponding descriptions.
1. **Waiting Times Display**: Waiting times for each specialist and procedure are shown side-by-side, with procedures bolded and waiting times in a smaller font for differentiation.
1. **Personalized Referral List**: Users can access a personalized referral list, with options to view received, accepted, and denied referrals, each showing the date of the event.
1. **Referral Status Tracking**: Clickable tabs for received, accepted, and denied events provide stakeholders with real-time status updates on their referrals.

This application aims to create transparency and accessibility to wait times in Alberta, improving interpersonal relationships with medical homes and fostering a patient-centered care approach.
